/** Algorithm analysis 

Absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors.

We can evelate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size. We can measure this in two ways;

 - Time complexity: Amount of time taken by an  algort algorithm to run, as a functoin of input size. 

 - Space complexity: Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a functoin of input size
