//Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array. 

//Bubble sort is not the best sorting algorithm in the real world!

const arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]

// bubbleSort(arr) -> Should return [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]

//Overall Idea;

//Compare adjacent elements in the array and swap the positions if they are not in the intended order. This
//Repeat the instruction as you step through each element in the array 
//Once you step through the whole array with no swaps, the array is sorted.
